# Fullstack Starter

A minimal starter template for CS 248 full-stack (client + server) projects.  
This repo includes:

- A basic **Express** server (`server.js`)
- A **public/** folder for your client-side HTML/CSS/JS
- A simple example API endpoint
- Built-in support for **GitHub Codespaces**
- A clean, predictable project structure for your assignments

Use this as the starting point for any project that requires both:
1. A browser-based web app (HTML + CSS + JS), **and**
2. A Node/Express service with API routes.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Codespaces)

1. Click **“Use this template → Create a new repository”**
2. Make sure the **owner** is your personal GitHub account  
   *(or the class organization, if instructed).*
3. Create and open a **Codespace** on the new repo.
4. In the Codespaces terminal, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
5. Codespaces will prompt:
    “Your application is available on port 3000”
   Click Open in Browser.
   You should now see the contents of public/index.html, served by Express.
